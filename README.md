#Customer Churn Prediction

A Machine Learning project that predicts customer churn and suggests actionable strategies to improve retention. Built using Python and Scikit-learn, achieving 86% accuracy.

Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a customer is likely to leave a service (churn). By analyzing historical customer data, the model provides insights into factors that drive churn and suggests actionable strategies to retain customers.

Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning, including handling missing values  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualization of key churn factors  
- Implementation of **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** models  
- Model evaluation and performance reporting (accuracy, precision, recall)  
- Suggested retention strategies: targeted discounts and improved onboarding for new users

Tech Stack
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

Key Learnings
- Handling real-world datasets with missing or inconsistent data  
- Feature selection and engineering for better model performance  
- Comparing multiple models and selecting the best performing one  
- Translating data insights into actionable business strategies
